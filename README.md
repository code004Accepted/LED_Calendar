# LED Calendar

This allows you to view an dynamically updated LED train station board. The only difference being that instead of displaying train departures, they now display the events in your calendar.

To begin, set up your own calendar, preferrably on iCloud or Outlook. Share the calendar or make the calendar public, then paste the URL of your calendar into the url section in the config file. Then change the config file to suit your needs.

This repo includes a ttf font file named [DotMatrix](https://www.dafont.com/dot-matrix.font).
